# Slack Instructions

Slack will be use for our (out of) classroom discussions and also a question/answer forum. If you have question outside of class, please ask it via Slack. This will allow everyone to see the question and responses. Students are also encouraged to answer questions if they know the answer. I expect all students to participate and does affect your grade. It is also recommended to download the app, but not required. Slack is a tool used in by most development teams in industry, so it will pay off the more you learn and use this tool.
