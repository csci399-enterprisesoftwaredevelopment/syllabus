## Course Description

This hands-on, project-oriented course explores through research the principles and tools involved in the design and construction of enterprise applications. Although the course focuses on the Java EE platform, the basic concepts and experiences extend to other enterprise systems. Topics include an overview of enterprise systems and architecture, data layer integration through ORM, middleware development, and API design. Development will include Relational database design and overcoming the object-relational impedance mismatch and client development to access the API.

## Prerequisites

* CSCI 230-Data Structures and Alghorithms or equivalent (CSCI 221 for non-majors)
* Understanding of Java programming language, data types, control flow, and basic method usage in Java
* Working knowledge of an IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ (IntelliJ preferred)
* Working knowledge of Git and Github

These won't be enforced by the instructor, but you will be pretty lost without understanding those concepts. If you need a refresher, take a look at the [Beginner Materials](#beginner-materials).

## Homework/Projects

All assignments are listed within the [Project Due Dates](https://github.com/CSCI399-enterprisesoftwaredevelopment/Project_Due_Dates).

### Workflow

1. Click on the appropiate project link in the [Project Due Dates](https://github.com/CSCI399-enterprisesoftwaredevelopment/Project_Due_Dates). This will take you to the project in [CSCI399-EnterpriseSoftwareDevelopment](https://github.com/csci399-enterprisesoftwaredevelopment) GitHub Organization account. 
2. Create your project in an editor of your choice and push to our GitHub Organization project.
3. Read the instructions provided by the README file.
4. Modify the files to complete your assignment.
5. Test your solution locally.
6. Create a README file to communicate anything you need to me.
7. Make sure all of your code is committed.
8. Push/sync up to GitHub.


***All assignments are due at the start of class on the specified date.***

   * You can continue to push fixes and improvements until the date (with no penalty) or for one week after (with letter grade penalty) – just add a comment in the pull request to let me know it's been updated.

   * I will leave appropriate feedback as an Issue inside of your repository.
   
   * Edit the README file in your repository to relay any feedback or instructions about your submission

#### Versions

For exercises with multiple Versions (`V1`, `V2`, etc.) listed in the README: these are intended as guidelines for how to complete the assignments in the smallest/simplest possible increments.  You are expected to reach the highest Version for each assignment by the due date.

### Requirements

* All applications must build, install, and run properly in a real Wildfly instance and data must persist in a relational database in a Redhat Linux environment. A README.md must be completed explainging the steps to get the project up and running.
* Assignments must be completed by the due date. Late assignments will only be accepted one week late and will be marked down a whole letter grade.


## Grading

The final grade for the course is based on 6 deliverables as follows:

1. Data Modeling for the applicaton.
2. Database implementation.
3. Wildfly setup and configuration.
4. API design and development.
5. Middleware application development with ORM integration.
6. Client applicaiton development. 

## Grading Scale

* A  90 - 100
* B+ 85 - 89
* B  80 - 84
* C+ 75 - 79
* C  70 - 74
* D+ 65 - 69
* D  60- 64
* F  0 - 59

## Course Schedule (tenative)

### Topics Covered:

* Week 1       Research Relation database theory and create a data model
* Week 2       Research JavaEE and EJB usage. 
* Week 3       Research JavaEE containers and ORM frameworks.
* Week 4       Research API security.
* Week 5       Research Client application development
* Week 6       Final project integrations and orchestrations.  



## Statements on Plagiarism

### SCPS

> The College of Charleston takes plagiarism very seriously and regards it as a form of fraud.  The definition of plagiarism that has been adopted by the School of Continuing and Professional Studies is as follows: "Plagiarism is presenting someone else's work as though it were one's own.  More specifically, plagiarism is to present as one's own words quoted without quotation marks from another writer; a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work; or facts or ideas gathered, organized, and reported by someone else, orally and/or in writing.  Since plagiarism is a matter of fact, not of the student's intention, it is crucial that acknowledgement of the sources be accurate and complete.  Even where there is not a conscious intention to deceive, the failure to make appropriate acknowledgement constitutes plagiarism.  Penalties for plagiarism range from failure for a paper or course to dismissal from the University.
